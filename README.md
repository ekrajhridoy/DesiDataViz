# DesiDataViz
ðŸ“– Project Description:
BharatMapViz is an interactive and dynamic data visualization dashboard built using Streamlit, Plotly Express, and Pandas. The project focuses on visualizing Indiaâ€™s district-level data across multiple parameters on a geographical map.
This dashboard allows users to explore data interactively by selecting various Indian states and visualizing key parameters like population, literacy rate, GDP, health indicators, or any other district-level metrics stored in the dataset.

The application displays a Mapbox scatter map where:
The size of each bubble represents a user-selected primary parameter.
The color of each bubble represents a user-selected secondary parameter.
This dual-parameter visualization enables users to identify geographic patterns, regional disparities, 
and correlations between different socio-economic indicators across India.

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used:
Python
Streamlit (for building interactive web dashboards)
Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
Plotly Express (for map visualizations)
Mapbox (for advanced map styling and rendering).
